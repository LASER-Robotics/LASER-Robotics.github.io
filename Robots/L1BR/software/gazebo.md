# Gazebo

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

Through the gazebo simulations we will be able to explore several features of the L1Br, being able to test its sensors, have a 3D visualization of an environment and even control it through a warehouse.

# Install Gazebo

To install the gazebo on your computer, you will first need to have [ROS](https://laser-robotics.github.io/warehouseIO/docs/software/ros) installed because it is through it that you will run the gazebo applications, so just go ahead with the installation:
