# What's L1Br?
Inspired by robots like the Kiva robot, the L1Br is a robot for distribution centers simulated through the gazebo. Using the control implemented in the robot, we can move around the warehouse,go under the shelves and activate the lift tray system,adapt the speed of the robot and perform the monitoring of several sensors. In order to bring simulation as close as possible to reality, we have implemented the laser sensor with an angle opening of 135Â° making it possible to calculate the distance to avoid collisions with the shelves,walls and even other robots, a camera at the bottom of the robot for reading qrcodes used to locate the robot, sensors such as wheel odometry and IMU are also present.
