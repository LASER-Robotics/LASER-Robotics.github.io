# Blender

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

With Blender it was possible to create files with the .dae extension, and apply texture to various parts of the robot.
