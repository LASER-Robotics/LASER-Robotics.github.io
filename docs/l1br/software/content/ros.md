# Robot Operating System (ROS)
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, we will be able to manage our entire robot through this application, from simulations to physical robot control.

For Linux beginners if you want to go deeper and know more about ROS, you can follow some tutorials to apply inside the robot. These tutorials will facilitate your new experience with the world of advanced robotics.
