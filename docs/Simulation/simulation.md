# Simulation

The simulation of a robot is a fundamental point for the construction of the project, it aims to simulate their behavior in a computer application, saving time and money. The L1Br model developed by LaSER comes with a range of features to make your simulation closer to reality, providing controls and monitoring of fundamental sensors in the construction of the robot, such as optical sensors and camera.
